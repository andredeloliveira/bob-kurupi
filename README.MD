#Bob Kurupi

## Repositório do site oficial do Bob Kurupi.

Feito de um fã e amigo.

Se você é desenvolvedor, web designer e quer fazer um site para a sua banda, esse é seu repositório.

Essa é uma distribuição open-source, sem fins lucrativos.

--

Made by a fan and friend .

If you're a developer, web designer and want to build your own website for your band, this is your repository.

This is an non-profit open-source software.

##Tech stack

The stack used is [Meteor.js](http://meteorjs.com) (full-stack JavaScript framework). Which has [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) on the server side and MongoDB as
a NoSQL database. For the client though, [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org) is on the way, providing clear and concise code as well as routing for the client side.


###Testing


Now the project is using TDD. Using Jasmine as a test library. SCRUM methods can really work now!

##Demo

Want to see it in action? Cool, now we have a demo.
Note that the security level is really low. Also, is for demo, so the admin area is open to everyone. Feel free to test.
The reason to show this demo is to have users feedback and improve design. Any suggestions, PLEASE create an issue with the
appropriated label and I'll be happy to see.

Do you want to help as well? Fork me! All pull requests will be carefully analyzed.

Here is the link for the [DEMO]('http://bobkurupi.meteor.com')



Thanks,


Andre de Oliveira.
